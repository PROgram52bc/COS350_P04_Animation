<!--

General
========

For each of your team's implementations, explain the following (where appropriate and applicable):

- details on calling conventions, input and output data formats, limitations, bugs, and special features.
- negative aspects of your program (limitations, known bugs)
- positive aspects (extensions, special features)
- describe your choice of modularization (abstractions), data structures, and algorithms
- explain anything you did that is likely to be different from what other students may have done
- justify any design decisions for which the rationale isn't immediately clear

Feel free to modify the structure of this `readme.html` file to fit the current assignment and to fit how you wish to present your findings.


!!! note: Math Typesetting
    Surround your math with double dollar signs to have [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) typeset it beautifully.
    To add a tilde in math mode (using dollar signs), use the `\sim` command.
    If an exponent has more than one character, you must surround it with curly braces.
    In the example below, the exponent for $T$ must use curly braces, but they aren't required for $N$.

    $$ \sim T^{1.2} N^2 $$

    Note: Typesetting like this is optional; feel free to use plain text if you'd like.


Submission
-----------

Use any zip utility to create a zip file containing all your code, this `readme.html` document, and any additional files of evidence (ex: generated images, screenshots).
Be sure to include all of the files, so that we can reproduce all of your images by running the ray tracer.

## Implementation details

The `AnimatedProperty` class is the main entrance to defining an animation.
It largely relies on Python's iterator/iterable interface, and the design is that once an `AnimatedProperty` object is set up properly, it can be iterated using a `for` loop to obtain the scene data for each frame.


## Evaluation

I spent most of the time designing the framework that would make it possible to create various types of animations with clear and direct syntax.

Currently the only ones implemented successfully is the `LerpPoint` class, which can linearly interpolate between two given points. This is demonstrated in the `moving_camera` scene, where several `LerpPoint`s are evaluated in parallel or stringed together to represent some interesting movements of camera location and target.

Future works include but are not limited to: a redesign of the nesting pattern for multiple `AnimatedProperty` so that child properties are more transparent to the parent property; implement a rotation animation, and have a scene with nested rotations to represent planet/moon movement; implement a bouncing ball animation with a global update hook to check whether balls collide with the floor and reverses its velocity upon such event.

## Team Evaluation

I worked with Christian for most of the first week, where we talked about possible directions and ways of collaboration. But later we thought since both of us had some demonstrable works done, and some of them are overlapping, it didn't seem to hurt if we simply submit our own assignments.
