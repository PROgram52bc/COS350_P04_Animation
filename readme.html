<!--

General
========

For each of your team's implementations, explain the following (where appropriate and applicable):

- details on calling conventions, input and output data formats, limitations, bugs, and special features.
- negative aspects of your program (limitations, known bugs)
- positive aspects (extensions, special features)
- describe your choice of modularization (abstractions), data structures, and algorithms
- explain anything you did that is likely to be different from what other students may have done
- justify any design decisions for which the rationale isn't immediately clear

Feel free to modify the structure of this `readme.html` file to fit the current assignment and to fit how you wish to present your findings.


!!! note: Math Typesetting
    Surround your math with double dollar signs to have [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) typeset it beautifully.
    To add a tilde in math mode (using dollar signs), use the `\sim` command.
    If an exponent has more than one character, you must surround it with curly braces.
    In the example below, the exponent for $T$ must use curly braces, but they aren't required for $N$.

    $$ \sim T^{1.2} N^2 $$

    Note: Typesetting like this is optional; feel free to use plain text if you'd like.


Submission
-----------

Use any zip utility to create a zip file containing all your code, this `readme.html` document, and any additional files of evidence (ex: generated images, screenshots).
Be sure to include all of the files, so that we can reproduce all of your images by running the ray tracer.

# Ray Tracing Project

## Electives

### Directional Light

Directional light is implemented by adding an extra parameter to the `Light` class.

Light will always be from the same direction with the same intensity no matter where it hits.

#### Artifact
![Planets](artifacts/direction_light.png)

As shown, a directional light uniformly hits on all the spheres, creating an approximate scene for the planets in space lit by the sun light. Also notice that there is a shadow casted by planets that are close to each other.

### Refraction
Refraction is implemented using snell's law.

#### Artifact

![Refraction1](artifacts/refraction1.png)

![Refraction2](artifacts/refraction2.png)

As shown, The three big spheres have reflective, refractive, and diffusive properties respectively.

### Triangle
Triangle is implemented using Cramer's rule.

#### Artifact
![Triangle](artifacts/triangle.png)

As shown, a 3D Christmas tree is rendered using triangles.
